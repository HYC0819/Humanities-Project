            <h1>How Is This Caused By Urban Growth?</h1>
            <p>Unaffordability of real estate in Taipei is linked to urban growth since, as more people move from rural areas to Taipei, the demand for a place to live increases. Causing the price of real estate to increase. Normally, this wouldn't be that big of an issue, as the income of the working class increases along with time as well, but the salary of people in Taipei has been stagnant for nearly a decade.<br><img src="https://gpg-production-cdn.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/Taiwan-3/taiwan-House-price-to-income-ratio.gif" alt=""></p>

            <h1>Who Is Affected?</h1>
            <p>Lots of people are affected by real estate prices, these people include middle-class workers, as they cannot find a reasonably priced house, landlords, as they cannot buy materials to build houses at a reasonable price, and real estate investors, as they cannot find reasonably priced houses to invest in.</p>
