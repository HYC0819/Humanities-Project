            <h1>How Is This Caused By Urban Growth?</h1>
            <p>Due to urban growth, the population of Taipei increases, land becomes more and more limited, consequently making it appreciate in price. The reason real estate seems so expensive in Taipei is because the average income of a person in Taipei has been stagnant for around a decade. Making land unaffordable for many people.<br><img src="https://gpg-production-cdn.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/Taiwan-3/taiwan-House-price-to-income-ratio.gif" alt=""></p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Who Is Affected?</h1>
            <p>This is a challenge for a big portion of people living and working in Taipei, because they don't have enough money to live in a decent home, and their paycheck has barely risen in the past few years. This also has an effect on investors and landlords, because investors cannot find reasonably priced houses to invest in, and landlords cannot build houses for a reasonable price due to more expensive supplies and materials.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Why Daan District?</h1>
            <p>Throughout the past 10 years, the average price of real estate in Daan has risen the most. It is currently the district with highest real estate price in all of Taipei, with a average price of NT$38.21 million per apartment (SGD$1.7 million )</p>
            <div class="fact"><h1>Fun Fact:</h1><p>Wanhua is the district with the lowest average real estate price, with an average price of NTD$16.35 million (SGD$700k)</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Why has the wages been stagnant?</h1>
            <p>A cause of unaffordability of real estate is because of low wages. The reason that wages are so low in Taiwan is that China started competing with Taiwan, and shipping similar goods. So, most the countries originally importing from Taiwan switched over to buying from China.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>What are some solutions for this challenge?</h1>
            <p>A potential solution for low wages is the government providing the people with financial support, so they can still afford homes and essentials while still having a low wage. Another way is by having the government encourage businesses to move to Taiwan so they can improve the economy.</p>
