        <h1>How Is This Caused By Urban Growth?</h1>
        <p>With urban growth, the city found that more business was going to be conducted here, and most of the buildings in Taipei were quite old and unfit for the job. Therefore, it adapted by building more high-rise buildings like skyscrapers to accommodate businesses in Taipei and businesses that were moved to Taipei. <br><img src="https://i.insider.com/4f036c1469bedd3654000009?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp" alt="Inside Taipei 101"><br><span style="color: grey; font-size: 1vw;">Inside of Taipei 101</span></p>

        <h1>Who Is Affected?</h1>
        <p>CBD's and business buildings are an opportunity for people who are looking for a new area for offices or even small businesses. It is also an opportunity for Taipei to grow their economy even further, with new businesses coming to their city. These business buildings are also an opportunity for corporations who own these buildings to get money, such as Taipei Financial Center, who owns Taipei 101,  receives income from the businesses that they accommodate.</p>
